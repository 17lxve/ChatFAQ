    The representation of the MML as a Django model

    Attributes
    ----------
    prev: str
        The id of the previous MML, typically to which this one answers. Thanks to this we can reconstruct the whole
         conversation in order.
    transmitter: JSONField
        The type of agent (human/bot) that generated this message.
        * first_name str:
            The first name of the sending agent
        * last_name str:
            The last name of the sending agent
        * type str:
            Its type: bot or human
    receiver: JSONField
        The agent to which this message is intended. Is this property ****required? Could it be the transmitter is
        entirely unknown to whom is communicating?
    conversation: str
        A unique identifier that groups all the messages sent within the same conversation.
         There is no Conversation model, instead, a conversation is represented by the group of
         messages that share the same 'conversation' value, and their order is determined by
         the 'prev' attribute.
    conversation_name: str
        A name that describes the conversation. Since a conversation is a virtual concept
         that does not have its own entity, this property is held by the first message in the
         conversation, which has 'prev' set to null.
    send_time: str
        The moment at which this message was sent.
    confidence: float
        How certain the bot is about its answer (required when transmitter = bot)
    threshold: float
        The minimal confidence the user would accept from the bot (required when transmitter = human)
    meta: JSONField
        any extra info out of the bot domain the agen considers to put in
    stacks: list
        contains the payload of the message itself.
        * text str:
            Plain text
        * html str:
            HTML that should be interpreted
        * image str:
            Image content
        * quick_replies JSONField:
            A list of CTAs. If this field is present it needs to contain at least 1 item. It is assumed that if it only contains an **id** it would mean is a response (a choose quick_replied) of a previous MML, being this id the same as the choose CTA
            * text str:
                The text to display on the CTA button
            * id str:
                an identifier to use later on as a reference in the response
            * meta JSONField:
                any extra info out of the bot domain the agen considers to put in
        * response_id str:
            In case the response is an indexed item on a database (as such the answer of a FAQ)
        * satisfaction str:
            For the user to express its satisfaction to the given botâ€™s answer
