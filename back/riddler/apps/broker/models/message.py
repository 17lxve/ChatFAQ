            Its type: bot or human
    receiver: JSONField
        The agent to which this message is intended. Is this property ****required? Could it be the transmitter is entirely unknown to whom is communicating?
    conversation: str

    send_time: str

    confidence: float
        How certain the bot is about its answer (required when transmitter = bot)

    meta: JSONField
