The ChatFAQ admin will be a node application that allows you to manage your chatbot's relevant data from the browser.

## Dashboard

## Labeling

The Labeling section of the ChatFAQ admin tool is designed to facilitate the management and improvement of your chatbot's interactions. It provides various tools to search, filter, and review chatbot conversations for effective training and enhancement of the bot's performance.

### Conversation Search and Filtering

#### Search Functionality

*Initial Screen*: Upon accessing the Labeling section, you will be greeted with a search bar. This feature allows you to locate specific conversations of interest based on their content or title. It's an efficient way to quickly find and analyze interactions relevant to your needs.

#### Filtering Options

- _Filter by Tag_: This option enables you to filter conversations based on the specific chatbot you want to evaluate. It's useful for environments where multiple chatbots are being managed and assessed.
- *Date Range Selection*: You can filter conversations by their date range. This feature is particularly helpful when you need to review or analyze interactions from a specific period.
- *Conversation Status Filter*: There are three statuses you can filter by, to efficiently manage your review process:
    - *Reviewed*: Select this to view all Question & Answer (Q&A) units that have been fully reviewed.
    - *To Review*: Use this filter to find conversations where no Q&A units have been reviewed yet, indicating they are pending your analysis.
    - *Under Review*: This filter shows conversations where some Q&A units are currently under review, indicating an ongoing evaluation process.
