## Installation

The system comprises three main components that you need to install:

![ChatFAQ Components](./_static/images/chatfaq_components.png)


- The back-end ([install](./modules/back/index.rst)) manages the comunication between all the components. It also houses the database for storing all the data related to the chatbots, datasets, models, etc...


- The SDK ([install](./modules/sdk/index.rst)) launches a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) server to execute transitions and events from the posted FSM definitions.


- The widget ([install](./modules/widget/index.rst)) is a JS browser client application from which the user interacts with the bot.
