This file is intended for writing down all those TODOs/tech. deb. you know it needs to be addressed.

- [ ] We should support filesystem storage as default storage.
- [ ] Intent name and utterance generation is done with OpenAI, it should work with each LLM provider.
- [ ] Clusterization for intent generation doesn't work with ColBERT retriever yet.
- [ ] We should unify the back Dockerfiles into one.
- [ ] Modularize dependencies between cpu/gpu and other divisions.
- [ ] RAGs should not be loaded in shared celery memory, but in another service which celery calls.
